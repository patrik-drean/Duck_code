<h1 align="center" style="border-bottom: 3px solid #a8aeb7"> Duckcode Blog</h1>
A personal blog to show my progress and share knowledge with others who are also in the learning process.

## Project Overview
**Framework:** Django <br/>
**Team Members:** Patrik Drean<br/>

## Project Details
Article topics include many subjects such as deployment, soft skills, different programming languages, etc. My goal is to write one blog post a week. I try to showcase/teach the most recent thing I've been focusing on.

## Lessons Learned 
<ul>Â  
  <li>It's surprising the response you get if you put out good content. I was expecting to have a handful of views but ended up having hundreds of visitors monthly.</li>
  <li>I learned social media strategies as I've developed my Twitter account from 0 to a 1,000+ followers in a matter of months.</li>
  <li>I became more proficient in technologies such as Heroku, YAML/JSON, and PostgreSQL</li>
</ul>
